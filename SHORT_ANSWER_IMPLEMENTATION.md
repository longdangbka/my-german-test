# Short Answer Question Type Implementation

## Overview
Added support for a new question type called "Short Answer" that allows users to provide text-based answers to questions.

## Syntax
```markdown
--- start-question
TYPE: Short

Q: Who invents $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$?
A: Pitago
E: He invents the formula in the year xxx

| a   | b   |
| --- | --- |
| 1   | 2   |

--- end-question
```

## Components Structure

### 1. **Question Format**
- **TYPE:** `Short` - Identifies this as a Short Answer question
- **Q:** Question text (supports LaTeX, tables, code blocks, images)
- **A:** Correct answer (the expected response)
- **E:** Explanation text (optional, supports all formatting)

### 2. **UI Behavior**

#### **Before "Show Answer":**
- Displays the question content with full formatting support
- Shows a single-line text input field labeled "Your answer:"
- User can type their response

#### **After "Show Answer":**
- **User Input Display:**
  - If answered: Shows user's input with green (correct) or red (incorrect) background
  - If blank: Shows "(no answer)" placeholder with gray background
- **Feedback Symbol:** ‚úÖ for correct, ‚ùå for incorrect
- **Expected Answer:** Shows correct answer in gray background box
- **Explanation:** Displays explanation text below (if provided)

### 3. **Answer Checking Logic**
- Case-insensitive string comparison
- Trims whitespace from both user input and expected answer
- Same logic as True/False questions for consistency

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified:

#### **1. New Component: `src/questionTypes/ShortAnswer.js`**
- Complete question renderer with input handling
- Feedback display logic
- Support for LaTeX, images, tables, code blocks
- Consistent styling with other question types

#### **2. Updated: `src/questionTypes/index.js`**
```javascript
import * as ShortAnswer from './ShortAnswer';

export const questionTypes = {
  'T-F': TrueFalse,
  'CLOZE': Cloze,
  'Short': ShortAnswer,  // Added Short Answer support
};
```

#### **3. Updated: `src/questions.js`**
- Added parsing logic for 'Short' type questions
- Follows same pattern as T-F questions
- Extracts Q:, A:, and E: sections properly

### Answer Processing:
- **Initialization:** `{ [questionId]: '' }` - Empty string for each question
- **Validation:** Compares user input to expected answer (case-insensitive)
- **Feedback:** 'correct' or 'incorrect' string stored in feedback object

## Testing

### **Test Question Available:**
Location: `C:\Users\HOANG PHI LONG DANG\REACT CODE\App\my-test-vault\test.md`

### **Expected Test Flow:**
1. Load the test quiz file
2. See "Short Answer" question with LaTeX and table
3. Type an answer (try "Pitago" for correct, anything else for incorrect)
4. Click "üëÅÔ∏è See Answer"
5. Verify feedback shows:
   - Your input with appropriate color
   - ‚úÖ/‚ùå symbol
   - Correct answer in gray box
   - Explanation text below

### **Verification Points:**
- ‚úÖ LaTeX renders correctly in question
- ‚úÖ Table displays properly
- ‚úÖ Input field accepts text
- ‚úÖ "Pitago" shows as correct (green + ‚úÖ)
- ‚úÖ Other answers show as incorrect (red + ‚ùå)
- ‚úÖ Empty answer shows "(no answer)" + ‚ùå
- ‚úÖ Explanation displays with formatting

## Browser and Electron Support
- ‚úÖ Web version: http://localhost:3002
- ‚úÖ Electron development: `npm run electron-dev`
- ‚úÖ Electron built: `.\dist\win-unpacked\My German Test.exe`

## Future Enhancements Possible
