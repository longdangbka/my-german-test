# Electron App UI Synchronization Fix

## Issue Description
The Electron app was not showing the same UI behavior as the web version, particularly for the new CLOZE and True/False feedback functionality.

## Root Cause
1. **Build Cache Issues**: The Electron app was using cached build files that didn't include the latest React changes
2. **Development vs Production Loading**: Different loading mechanisms for development and production builds
3. **Browser Cache**: Potential caching issues in the Electron browser instance

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Build System Fixes
- Rebuilt React app with latest changes: `npm run build`
- Rebuilt Electron app with latest React build: `npm run dist-portable-full`
- Created fast development builds: `npm run dist-dev-fast`

### 2. Development Experience Improvements
- Added cache-busting for development mode with timestamp parameter
- Added Ctrl+R reload shortcut in development mode
- Added "Reload" menu item in the File menu
- Improved development debugging with DevTools auto-open

### 3. Code Changes Made
**File: `main.js`**
- Added cache-busting URL parameter for development: `http://localhost:3002?t=${timestamp}`
- Added keyboard shortcut handler for Ctrl+R reload
- Added "Reload" menu item for easier testing

## Testing Instructions

### Method 1: Compare Both Versions
1. Run `test-both-versions.bat` to start both web and Electron versions
2. Test the same quiz in both versions
3. Verify identical behavior for "See Answer" functionality

### Method 2: Test Electron Development Version
1. Ensure React dev server is running: `npm start`
2. Run Electron in dev mode: `npm run electron-dev`
3. Test the new feedback behavior

### Method 3: Test Built Electron App
1. Build and run: `npm run dist-portable-full`
2. Run the executable: `.\dist\MyGermanTest-Portable-0.1.0.exe`
3. Test the new feedback behavior

## Expected Behavior
Both web and Electron versions should now show:

### CLOZE Questions
- **Before "See Answer"**: Normal input fields
- **After "See Answer"**: 
  - User input (if any) with colored background
  - ✅/❌ symbol 
  - Expected answer in gray background
  - No auto-filling of empty fields

### True/False Questions  
- **Before "See Answer"**: Dropdown selector
- **After "See Answer"**:
  - User selection (if any) with colored background
  - ✅/❌ symbol
  - Expected answer in gray background
  - No auto-selection of correct answer

## Files Modified
- `src/questionTypes/Cloze.js` - Updated feedback display
- `src/questionTypes/TrueFalse.js` - Updated feedback display  
- `src/questionTypes/TableWithLatex.js` - Updated table CLOZE feedback
- `src/App.js` - Removed auto-filling behavior
- `main.js` - Added cache-busting and reload functionality

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Build and test web version
npm run build
npm start
# Open http://localhost:3002

# Build and test Electron version
npm run dist-portable-full  
.\dist\MyGermanTest-Portable-0.1.0.exe

# Quick development testing
npm run electron-dev
# Use Ctrl+R to reload if needed
```

The issue should now be resolved with both versions showing identical behavior.
