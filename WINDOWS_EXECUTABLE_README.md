## 🛠️ Development Commands

### Building from Source
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build React app
npm run build

# Create Windows executable
npx electron-builder --win --publish=never

# Create portable package
.\create-portable.bat
```

### Development Mode
```bash
# Run in development
npm run electron-dev

# Start React dev server (port 3001)
npm start
```

## 📋 Build Scripts

### Available Scripts
- `npm run electron` - Run the Electron app in production mode
- `npm run electron-dev` - Run in development mode with hot reload
- `npm run dist-win` - Build Windows executable (installer + portable)
- `npm run dist-all` - Build for Windows, Mac, and Linux
- `.\build-windows.bat` - Complete Windows build script
- `.\build-windows.ps1` - PowerShell build script
- `.\create-portable.bat` - Create portable package

## 🔧 Configuration

### Electron Builder Settings
The build configuration is in `package.json` under the `"build"` section:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "appId": "com.example.my-german-test",
    "productName": "My German Test",
    "win": {
      "target": ["nsis", "portable"],
      "forceCodeSigning": false
    }
  }
}
```

### Main Process Files
- `main.js` - Electron main process (window creation, menu, IPC)
- `preload.js` - Secure bridge between main and renderer processes

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **App won't start**
   - Check Windows Defender/Antivirus (may flag unsigned executable)
   - Ensure all files in `MyGermanTest-Portable` folder are present
   - Try running as administrator

2. **Missing files/features**
   - Verify `resources` folder contains `app.asar`, `audios`, and `vault`
   - Check that the React build completed successfully

3. **Performance issues**
   - Close other applications to free memory
   - The app includes Chromium, so it uses similar resources to a browser

### Windows Security
- The executable is **unsigned** (to avoid code signing costs)
- Windows may show security warnings on first run
- This is normal for unsigned applications

## 📦 Distribution Options

### Option 1: Portable (Current)
- ✅ No installation required
- ✅ Self-contained
- ✅ Easy to distribute
- ❌ Larger file size

### Option 2: Installer (Alternative)
You can also create a Windows installer:
```bash
npm run dist-win
# Look for .exe installer in dist/ folder
```

### Option 3: Windows Store
For Microsoft Store distribution, additional configuration would be needed.

## 🎉 Success!

You now have a fully functional Windows executable of your German test application! 

**Next Steps:**
1. Test the `My German Test.exe` thoroughly
2. Share the `MyGermanTest-Portable` folder with users
3. Consider creating an installer if needed
4. Optionally add code signing for enhanced security

The application retains all the functionality of your original React app while providing a native Windows desktop experience.
