# Implementation Summary: Custom Vault Folder Feature

## ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

### Core Functionality
1. **Custom Vault Selection**: Users can select any folder containing .md files as their quiz vault
2. **Persistent Settings**: Custom vault paths are saved and restored across app sessions
3. **Intelligent Fallback**: Automatic fallback to default vault if custom path becomes unavailable
4. **Validation**: Selected folders are validated to ensure they contain quiz files
5. **Auto-Refresh**: Quiz list automatically updates when vault is changed

### Technical Implementation
1. **Electron Main Process** (`main.js`):
   - Added folder selection dialog using `dialog.showOpenDialog`
   - Implemented persistent storage in user data directory
   - Enhanced vault path resolution with custom path priority
   - Added comprehensive IPC handlers for vault management

2. **Preload Script** (`preload.js`):
   - Exposed secure vault management APIs to renderer
   - Maintained security isolation while enabling functionality

3. **React Components**:
   - **VaultFolderManager**: Complete UI for vault settings with modal interface
   - **TestSelector**: Integrated vault settings and automatic refresh on vault changes

### User Experience
1. **Intuitive Interface**: Gear icon in header provides easy access to vault settings
2. **Clear Feedback**: Status messages show success/error states and file counts
3. **Non-Disruptive**: Feature only appears in Electron app, invisible in web browser
4. **Informative**: Shows current vault path, type (custom/default), and file count

### Testing Completed
- ✅ Default vault functionality (backward compatibility maintained)
- ✅ Custom folder selection and validation
- ✅ Settings persistence across app restarts
- ✅ Fallback behavior when custom vault unavailable
- ✅ UI responsiveness and error handling
- ✅ Integration with existing LaTeX rendering
- ✅ Both development and packaged Electron builds

### Files Created/Modified
- `main.js` - Enhanced with vault management logic
- `preload.js` - Added vault management IPC exposure
- `src/components/VaultFolderManager.jsx` - New component for vault settings
- `src/components/TestSelector.jsx` - Integrated vault settings
- `CUSTOM_VAULT_FEATURE.md` - Comprehensive documentation

### Benefits for Users
1. **Flexibility**: Organize quiz files anywhere on the system
2. **Multiple Collections**: Easy switching between different quiz sets
3. **Cloud Integration**: Can use folders in cloud storage (Dropbox, OneDrive, etc.)
4. **Team Collaboration**: Share vault folders with others
5. **Backup-Friendly**: Custom vaults can be included in backup routines
