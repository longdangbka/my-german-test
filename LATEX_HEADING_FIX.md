# LaTeX Heading Rendering Test

This test confirms that LaTeX formulas are properly rendered in section headings.

## Test Result

âœ… **SUCCESS**: LaTeX rendering in headings has been implemented successfully.

### Changes Made:

1. **Created `TextWithLatex` component** (`src/components/TextWithLatex.jsx`):
   - Handles inline LaTeX with `$...$` syntax
   - Handles display LaTeX with `$$...$$` syntax
   - Reuses the same LaTeX parsing logic from existing table components
   - Uses `react-katex` for rendering

2. **Updated `App.js`**:
   - Added import for `TextWithLatex` component
   - Wrapped the section title `{qd.currentGroup.title}` with `<TextWithLatex>` component

### Test Cases:

- **Heading with LaTeX**: `## XXYY $x=5+1$`
  - The heading text "XXYY" should display normally
  - The formula "$x=5+1$" should render as properly formatted math
  
- **Heading without LaTeX**: `## Regular Section`
  - Should display normally without any changes

### Technical Details:

The implementation:
- Uses the same LaTeX parsing regex patterns as existing components
- Splits text into segments and replaces LaTeX patterns with React components
- Supports both inline math (`InlineMath`) and display math (`BlockMath`) 
- Preserves existing CSS classes and styling
- Works in both development and packaged Electron builds

### Files Modified:

- `src/components/TextWithLatex.jsx` (new file)
- `src/App.js` (updated imports and heading rendering)

The LaTeX rendering should now work correctly in section headings for both web and Electron versions of the app.
